NAME
    popruxi.pl - pop proxy with uid mapping ability

SYNOPSIS
    popruxi [*options*...]

        --man           show man-page and exit
     -h,--help          display this help and exit

        --server=x      upstream pop server
        --serverport=x  port on upstream pop server
        --listenport=x  on which port should we be listening
        --dbfile=x      where is the uid database

DESCRIPTION

    When migrating a pop server to a new host, the message uids will
    normally change. This causes all clients to re-download all their mail
    after the change.

    This proxy is able to replace message uids as reported by the "UIDL"
    command based on a list stored in an sqlite database.
